The user can choose to play against other players or none at all. The user tries to get the highest hand possible. The game starts with an ante (a forced bet in which all players put an equal amount of money or chips into the pot before the deal begins). Then each player is dealt 5 cards, all face down. The first betting round begins. The players can choose to either raise, call, check or fold. Each player then specifies how many cards they want to replace and those cards are replaced by cards from the deck. After the draw phase, the second betting round begins with the player who opened the first round. The remaining players can choose to either raise, call, check or fold. After that the players reveal and compare their hands. The player with the highest hand takes the pot. If tied, the pot is split between players who have the same value of hand.
